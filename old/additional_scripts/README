This directory contains scripts that we used to convert the data;

migrate-to-single-locus.py: conversion of the bird dataset (see data section) to single locus phylip files using a migrate infile 

mammals-i2r.py: transforms the interleaved multilocus phylip data format for the mammals into files in a folder, these files are non-interleaved and one phylip file per locus.

mosquito-conversion.txt: contains instructions how to convert the mosquito fasta files into files readable by topiccontml.py (the instructions assume that the reader is familiar with UNIX)

The simulation analysis is hardcoded into the program topiccontml.py using
for example:
python topiccontml.py -f sim_100_0.0_100 -sd 0.0 -m 3 -gt rm_row -nl 100
python topiccontml.py -f sim_100_0.01_100 -sd 0.01 -m 3 -gt rm_row -nl 100

The simulated data assumes a rooted tree ((a,c),(b,d)) as the true tree simulated with various split times between the groups (a,c) and (b,d) [-sd tau], we only concerned with unrooted topologies ((a,c),b,d) for the comparison
the first example uses a population split at tau=0 , the second at a tau=0.01 (see the table in the manuscript)
